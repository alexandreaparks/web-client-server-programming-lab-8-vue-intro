Vue.js

- a JavaScript front-end framework - used for creating structure in complex JavaScript
- runs in browser

Other front-end frameworks:
- Reactjs (most popular, not beginner-friendly)
- Angular

- Vue.js was inspired by Reactjs, much more beginner-friendly

Concepts: MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel)

Model - data the webpage needs - could be part of the page, included from a database server, accessed via API calls

View - web page - what user sees

ViewModel - connects the view and model - contains application logic
    Directives - control what is displayed in view based on the state of application's data
    DOM Listeners - receive messages from the view, and may update data in the model

More concepts:

Data binding - connecting data in the model to the view - displays data from the model on page using directives

Vue is Reactive - page updates automatically in response to changes in data
