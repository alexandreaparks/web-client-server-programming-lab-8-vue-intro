This error means that you are trying to use a variable/function within the template that
has not yet been defined. Or maybe the variable/function was defined, but it was
not included in the return statement object.

You can fix this error by making sure all variables/functions needed are defined and returned.
You may also simply have a typo in your variable/function name that needs to be fixed.

It wouldn't be a good idea to ignore this warning message because there will be something
missing from your webpage that you intended to include in the HTML template. Other parts of
the webpage will probably look and work correctly, but there will be that missing data that
can't be accessed until it's defined and returned properly.
